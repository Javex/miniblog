miniblog
========

Introduction
------------

miniblog is a small application that allows you to setup a really basic blog. 
It is kind of a "quick doesn't mean dirty"-idea (see [eevee on this](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/07/28/quick-doesnt-mean-dirty/)).
I wanted to build a blog software very quickly that only provides the most basic features:

 - Writing articles
 - Comments
 - Adding articles
 - Some optional additional pages
 
Note: This is currently a development build and not ready for release.

For more information refer to the [documentation](https://javex-miniblog.readthedocs.org/).
