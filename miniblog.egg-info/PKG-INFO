        Introduction
        ------------
        
        miniblog is a small application that allows you to setup a really basic blog. 
        It is kind of a "quick doesn't mean dirty"-idea (see [eevee on this](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/07/28/quick-doesnt-mean-dirty/)).
        I wanted to build a blog software very quickly that only provides the most basic features:
        
         - Writing articles
         - Comments
         - Adding articles
         - Some optional additional pages
         
        Note: This is currently a development build and not ready for release.
